This ideology of giving the interns first hand experience during their internship enhanced IIV’s quality as an internship provider in Vietnam, and also a close model to professional internships in New York or London. In addition, an emphasis on the “giving back to society” spirit was also put forward. Every intern was required to work on a community project of their own, contributing through volunteerism and leadership.",
